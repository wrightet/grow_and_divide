JavaScript Project Proposal

# Background

Grow and Divide is a clone of Agar.io. Players are cells and must eat to grow. The only safety relies on size. The bigger you are the safer you are. Larger cells will eat smaller cells gaining their mass. If you are eaten, the game is over.

# MVPâ€™s

Phase 1
Players can move around the map, playing as a cell.
Players can eat food to grow in size.
Players can dump mass to move faster.
Phase 2
After the player reaches a certain size they will be able to divide into two cells.
Players can eat enemy AI if the player is larger.
Phase 3
There are AI players who try to grow and eat the player.
Players cells combine after a set interval.
Phase 4
Bonus: websockets for multiplayer.

Besides the entry file I am currently only planning on using canvas.

# Timeline

Day 1: Set up node modules. Write an entry file. Learn basics on Canvas. 
Day 2: Build the cell file. And a moving object file. Create a board object and connect the cell to it. Create food and render it randomly to the board. Allow the player to dump mass. 
Day 3: Cell division and controls.
Day 4: Create AI to attack the player.
Day 5: Bonus :learn and implement Websockets.
